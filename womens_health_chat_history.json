I\u2019ve also had some skin changes around the area\u2014it looks kind of red and there\u2019s a bit of dimpling, almost like the skin is thickening.

    "response": "**Understanding Breast Changes**\n\nThe changes you've described - a lump, skin redness, and dimpling - can be concerning. These symptoms may indicate an underlying breast condition, which requires further evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n\n* **See a healthcare professional promptly.** They can perform a breast exam, review your medical history, and recommend appropriate tests (e.g., mammogram, ultrasound).\n* **Be prepared to discuss:** Age of first period, family history of breast cancer, and any changes in your breasts or nipples.\n* **Urgent medical attention is not needed:** You have not reported any fever or other signs of infection. However, seeking medical advice sooner rather than later can ensure timely diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**Preventive Care:**\n\n* **Schedule regular breast exams with a healthcare professional:** Typically recommended starting at age 40, but can be adjusted based on individual risk factors.\n* **Perform monthly breast self-exams:** This helps you become familiar with your breasts and notice any changes early on.\n* **Maintain a healthy lifestyle:** Exercise, eat a balanced diet, and manage stress levels to reduce the risk of breast cancer.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\n**This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.** Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment."
